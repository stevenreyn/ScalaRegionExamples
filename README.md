ScalaRegionExamples
===================

Examples of exporting some regions of scala objects. Depends on the project
RegionViewer and Scala. Tested with Scala 2.10.2.

You should first read the documentation for the
[RegionViewer project](http://stevenreyn.github.io/RegionViewer). These Scala 
examples are in src/net/slreynolds/ds. The most basic example is ScalaTest.scala.
To run it, you will need to have your IDE setup with Scala and include the RegionViewer
project in your classpath.
